    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Turn the classic Italian salad of tomato, basil, and mozzarella into a complete meal with juicy grilled chicken and fresh corn.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ears fresh corn, shucked</li>
        <li>12 oz. orecchiette</li>
        <li>1 oz. Romano cheese, finely grated, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 c. basil, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Hot sauce, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring large pot of salted water to a boil. Add corn and cook 2 minutes. Transfer to cutting board.</li>
        <li>Add orecchiette to same pot and cook per package directions. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta.</li>
        <li>When corn is cool enough to handle but while pasta is still cooking, cut off kernels (you should have about 3 cups). Transfer 2 cups to blender along with Romano cheese, 3/4 cup pasta cooking water, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; puree until very smooth.</li>
        <li>Toss pasta with corn puree, adding some reserved pasta water, 1 Tbsp at a time, if pasta seems dry. Fold in reserved corn, scallions, and basil. Serve sprinkled with additional cheese and basil and with hot sauce if desired.</li>
    </ol>
