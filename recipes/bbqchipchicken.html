    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp. olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp. granulated garlic</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and pepper</li>
        <li>4 c. Lay’s barbecue-flavored potato chips or other barbecue potato chips, crushed</li>
        <li>4 5-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts, each split (making 8 small cutlets)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 oz. green beans, trimmed and halved</li>
        <li>1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>12 oz. Campari tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 450°F. Rub large rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon oil. Place flour in shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>In second shallow bowl, beat together eggs, garlic, 2 tablespoons water, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. In third bowl, place chips.</li>
        <li>Toss chicken in lemon juice. Dip chicken in flour, then in egg mixture (letting any excess drip off) and finally in potato chips, pressing gently to help adhere; transfer to prepared baking sheet. Roast until chicken is golden brown and cooked through, 12 to 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring medium saucepan of water to a boil and fill large bowl with ice water. Add 2 teaspoons salt to boiling water, then beans, and cook until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Immediately transfer to ice water to cool, then drain.</li>
        <li>In bowl, toss onion with vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; let sit 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and remaining tablespoon oil and toss to combine. Just before serving, toss with green beans and parsley and serve with chicken.</li>
    </ol>
